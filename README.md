# hackFS
In this project we made two ends, Provider and Client
The providers will put at the dispose their storage. So thei will run the script.sh on their linux machine and will connect to our private network on IPFS.
The clients will have the option to store data on our website if they have an NFT. The NFT's are generated when you create your account. For now we only have our 
dynamic NFT at the sign up process but we willintegrate it also in the storing process of files.
